  ## Description
  The past two weeks, our team, Max Y., Deena S., and Jason W. have built our first full-stack web application. Our project is called RMP, pronounced Ramp and is short for RateMyPlaylist. Our site was inspired by one of our own's passion for making Spotify playlist. Users that are signed up can submit their Spotify playlist URLs and have them be embedded on our site to be voted on by the community. The more "favorites" a playlist has, the higher it appears on our homepage's Hot Playlists. The backend of this project not only holds User data, but Playlist and Favorite model data as well. It was built primaryly using Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, JAWSDB, dotenv, and is written in JavaScript. The fronend of this project was build using Handlebars.js, TailwindCSS, Spotify's Embedded Player, and HTML. During the week and a half that our team was working, we made sure to collaborate and communicate effectively to accomplish our MVP goals. All parts of this project were worked on by different members and completion was a group effort.
